# Food Vision AI - Progress Tracking

## Recently Completed

### Authentication & Admin Access Control (NEWLY RESOLVED)
- [x] **Resolved Login Loop & "Access Denied" Errors:** Successfully fixed critical issue preventing admin access. The root cause was missing `EXECUTE` permission on the `public.get_my_role()` RPC function for the `authenticated` role. A migration file was created to version this fix.
- [x] **Stabilized Admin Layout Rendering:** Refactored `src/layouts/AdminLayout.tsx` to prevent rendering/routing loops during auth state changes, ensuring smoother navigation and loading of admin pages.
- [x] **Improved UI Error Handling for Auth:** Enhanced toast notification management in `src/hooks/useCurrentUserRole.ts` to prevent persistent error messages.

### Form & Submission Logic (Previously Completed)
- [x] `CustomerGallery.tsx`: Fixed Radix UI `Select.Item` receiving empty `value` prop.
- [x] `FoodVisionForm.tsx` (`use-food-vision-form.ts`): Resolved "Invalid hook call".
- [x] `triggerMakeWebhook.ts`: Removed Make.com webhook calls.
- [x] `FormNavigation.tsx` (`useFoodVisionFormSubmission.ts`): Ensured `isSubmitDisabled` is always boolean.
- [x] `additional-details-utils.ts`: Fixed `409 Conflict` on `additional_details` table by using `upsert`.

### Authentication & Access Control (Previous Fixes - Maintained)
- [x] Customer Authentication Flow (Login, Logout, Forgot Password, Reset Password)
- [x] Protected routes for customer portal (`/dashboard/customer/*`)
- [x] RLS policies for `public.clients` revised and fixed.

### Data Migration & Setup (Previously Completed)
- [x] Demo customer setup (`balanga@demo.com`).
- [x] Historical data consolidation for "חוף בלנגה".

### Customer Dashboard (Previously Completed)
- [x] Package display showing correct name and remaining servings.
- [x] Basic dashboard layout and navigation.
- [x] React Query integration for data fetching.
- [x] Error handling and loading states.

## Current Issues

### Critical
1.  **Admin Clients Page Implementation (NEW FOCUS)**
    *   The Admin Clients page is currently non-functional or "stuck".
    *   Needs complete implementation including: client listing, search/filter, view details, create, edit, status management, and package assignment.
    *   Requires verification of RLS policies for `public.clients` and related tables for admin operations.

### Medium
1.  **RLS Policy Review (Ongoing Maintenance)**
    *   Continue to review and verify RLS policies across the application as new features are added.

### Low
1.  **Radix UI Accessibility Warnings (Backlog)**
    *   `DialogContent` missing `DialogTitle` and `DialogDescription`.
2.  **React `sonner` Toast Warning (Backlog - Pending Verification)**
    *   `Cannot update a component (ForwardRef) while rendering a different component (ForwardRef)` - may have been mitigated by recent toast management changes.
3.  UI responsiveness improvements (general).
4.  Performance optimization (general).
5.  Code documentation (general).
6.  Test coverage (general).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Focus
1.  **Diagnose & Fix Admin Clients Page:**
    *   Locate the relevant code for the admin clients page.
    *   Investigate and resolve the current "stuck" state (check console, network, component logic).
2.  **Plan and Implement Admin Clients Page Features:**
    *   Define and develop core functionalities: list, view, create, edit clients.
    *   Ensure data synchronization and correct RLS for admin actions.

### Future Enhancements (Post-Critical Fixes)
1.  Address backlog UI warnings (Radix, Sonner) if still relevant.
2.  Review and complete RLS Implementation across the application.
3.  Optimize queries if performance issues arise.
4.  Improve overall error handling and loading states.
5.  Document all changes and resolutions thoroughly.
