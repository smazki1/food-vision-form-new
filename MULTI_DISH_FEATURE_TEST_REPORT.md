## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 🐛 ID Generation Bug (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: The `addDish()` function had a critical closure issue where multiple dishes added in succession received duplicate IDs instead of sequential ones.

**Solution Applied**: Fixed using functional state updates to ensure sequential ID generation (1, 2, 3, 4...)

**Problem**: Error handling tests weren't properly mocking failures, causing successful submissions when failures were expected.

**Solution**: Implemented proper mock isolation and setup for different test scenarios.
